The folder structure is as follows:

`data/` : Contains all the data

`code/` : Contains all R scripts

## Usage

To reproduce the results and figures, clone into this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/fischuu/LinearDimensionReductionInBioinformatics
```

adjust in then `runAnalysis.R` the path to the repository and then just run the script as is.
